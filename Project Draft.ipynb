We will create these paths by utilizing a for loop, where we can combine the path of the folder with a backslash and the file name to create the path of the file. Interestingly we cannot just add a single backslash to the path and file because a single backslash is a special character in Python, instead we have to pass two backslashes which Python will recognize as one. \n",

We will do some minor housekeeping with a command to add back leading zeros to the CIK number, reformatting the date from a string to a datetime format incase we want to create a sample based on date. We also need to actually create the URLS for the filings, the index files only come with half of the information needed to create the URL. Luckily we can simply add the first half of the URL which is not unique to the second half of the URL contained within the index filing which is unique. We also do some house keeping with Company names, removing special characters so we can use the company name to create file names later. Pandas will automatically truncate values to save memory, so we will need to stop it from truncating these values.\n",

This gives you a unique identifier to call the information as opposed to a list where you can only call stored information by the index where it is stored. Dictionaries and lists can be combined however to store multipule pieces of inforamtion under one key. I have found however it is often better to use multipule dictionaries than to combine datastructures as combining datastructures creates some unique problems, and messy code. Sometimes it is necessary and more convient, but it is rare.\n",

The for loop contains two if statements, we want to check if the file is saved in our index folder, and if it is we will open the file, and if it is not we will download the file."

Once we have the doc as a string we can also pass the .lower() function, which changes any capital letters to lower case letters, this way we do not need to worry about case senesitivity. We then define our regular expressions in the result variable, we give the regular expressions two cases to search for seperated by the '|' character. The first expression tells the program to search for aggregate market value, a number, a decimal, two more numbers, then any 7 characters. This is meant to look for numbers such as 7.0 billion or 8.00 million. The second regular expression just looks for a sentence containing 'aggregate market value' and returns that sentence. We then create an if statement to eliminate any text documents that did not return a result. If a result was not found the function will return '[]' therefore we can tell the if statement if the result does not equal '[]' then we want to store that result in our amv dict."

The following code is an alteration of Training NER at https://spacy.io/usage/examples. In this example the label and training data has been altered for our purposes. There are two challenges when building Spacy models, compute power, and datasets. Training a model can take minutes to days depending on the size of the dataset used, the amount of times the training loop is ran, and the comptuer power at your disposal. In my experiements it has been taking me about an hour to train a model on a 2080ti. "
